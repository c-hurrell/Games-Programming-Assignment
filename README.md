# Games-Programming-Assignment
Assignment for Games Programming, Game Engine made in C++, waiting on specifics

List of Improvements For AliEngine:

-> Revamp of ECS, Core issues being difficultly accessing the relationship backwards at times

-> Revamp of textures -> All textures should be loaded at the start of each scene and stored in the texture manager to reduce multiple texture instances

-> Expansion of audiomanager to act similarly to TextureManager holding all relevant audio objects and have other classes just access them when needed

-> Improvements on Collision AABB works fine but could work on fine tuning collision at somepoint post-assignment could switch to PhysX for handling and trying it out

-> Revamp of Text component as its current method is limited in usage and causes issues.

-> Will add more as needed
